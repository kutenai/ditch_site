# Introduction.

This is a simple Django site based on pinax_theme_bootstrap. This site gives me a login, and then a page with current information about my ditch, and the ability to control the status of the pump and zones.

# Stuff to do:

	- Add an option to schedule ditch events
	- Add the ability to cycle the zones over my watering period.
		- So I don't run one zone, then the next.. etc.. swap them around. 1 hour each.
		
	- Add some graphics - a nice chart of ditch level versus days/hours, etc.
